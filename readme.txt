== Description ==

This plugin adds a payment option cash on pickup, if for example the customer wants to pick up the product at the 
webshop owners store. This is different from cash on delivery because this often costs money and the product is delivered
to the customer.

== Installation ==


1. Upload `woocommerce-cash-on-pickup.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
